              brain imaging has contributed significantly to the understanding
              of different dementia syndromes. Over the past 20 years these
              imaging techniques have been increasingly used for clinical
              characterisation and differential diagnosis, and to provide
              insight into the effects on functional capacity of the brain,
              patterns of spatial distribution of different dementia syndromes
              and their natural history and evolution over time. Brain imaging
              is also increasingly used in clinical trials, as part of
              inclusion criteria and/or as a surrogate outcome measure. Here we
              review all the relatively specific findings that can be
              identified with different MRI and PET techniques in each of the
              most frequent dementing disorders.",

  abstract = "Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), also
              known as neuropsychiatric symptoms, represent a heterogeneous
              group of non-cognitive symptoms and behaviors occurring in
              subjects with dementia. BPSD constitute a major component of the
              dementia syndrome irrespective of its subtype. They are as
              clinically relevant as cognitive symptoms as they strongly
              correlate with the degree of functional and cognitive impairment.
              BPSD include agitation, aberrant motor behavior, anxiety,
              elation, irritability, depression, apathy, disinhibition,
              delusions, hallucinations, and sleep or appetite changes. It is
              estimated that BPSD affect up to 90\% of all dementia subjects
              over the course of their illness, and is independently associated
              with poor outcomes, including distress among patients and
              caregivers, long-term hospitalization, misuse of medication, and
              increased health care costs. Although these symptoms can be
              present individually it is more common that various
              psychopathological features co-occur simultaneously in the same
              patient. Thus, categorization of BPSD in clusters taking into
              account their natural course, prognosis, and treatment response
              may be useful in the clinical practice. The pathogenesis of BPSD
              has not been clearly delineated but it is probably the result of
              a complex interplay of psychological, social, and biological
              factors. Recent studies have emphasized the role of
              neurochemical, neuropathological, and genetic factors underlying
              the clinical manifestations of BPSD. A high degree of clinical
              expertise is crucial to appropriately recognize and manage the
              neuropsychiatric symptoms in a patient with dementia. Combination
              of non-pharmacological and careful use of pharmacological
              interventions is the recommended therapeutic for managing BPSD.
              Given the modest efficacy of current strategies, there is an
              urgent need to identify novel pharmacological targets and develop
              new non-pharmacological approaches to improve the adverse
              outcomes associated with BPSD.",
